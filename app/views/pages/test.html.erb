<p>
  <strong>
    Creates a button element that defines a submit button, resetbutton or a generic button which can be used in JavaScript, for example. You can use the button tag as a regular submit tag but it isnâ€™t supported in legacy browsers. However, the button tag allows richer labels such as images and emphasis, so this helper will also accept a block.
